 I2C Protocol Implementation:
 
• Implemented the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol in Verilog HDL, enabling efficient communication between microcontrollers and peripherals.

• Designed a master-slave architecture with support for multiple devices on a two-wire bus (SDA and SCL).

• Incorporated features like address recognition, bidirectional data transfer, and clock synchronization for enhanced protocol reliability.
